## Result

I got the assignment to redesign an existing vinyl plate, mine was 'You're A Woman, I'm A Machine' from Death From Above 1979. The feeling of the album needed to be a part of the design from both the outer sleeve, the inner sleeve and the label. This feeling was pain from a broken relationship, so I sompared this with a piece of food that has been fallen on the ground.
